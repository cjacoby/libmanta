ManatMIDI preset options work as follows:

Master Settings are applied first, followed by the individual settings. If you wish all of something but one to have a value, set the master as the general setting, and then set the specifics in the individual settings.

ALL settings must be kept in the form:
Label, value;

The semicolon and the comma are important! If the setting isn't working, check to make sure those things are present.

For Color values:
0 = off
1 = amber
2 = red
